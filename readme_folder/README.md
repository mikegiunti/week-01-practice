My name is Michele Giunti, I am a 2nd year MPP student. I come from Rome, Italy and I have entered the program right after obtaining my undergraduate degreee in Jacksonville, Florida.
I have experience in academic research in both Psychology and Sociology, as well as some areas of communication, which was the source of my first published paper.
During my undergraduate studies I was trained in SPSS, and had modules that included SAS, but I was only exposed to STATA by the time I started my graduate degree.
While this time was short, I feel rather confident utilizing it, and I more recently learned to utilize R for both data visualization and data wrangling (mainly tidyverse and some experience with CRAN).
My most recent research interest has involved urban planning and regeneration, with a concentration in architectural planning and business restoration within disadvantaged communities.
However, I have opted to turn towards my psychology background in my thesis by engaging with the problem of loneliness among U.S. adults, considering the influence of the pandemic on social interactions.

This, of course, is part of a much broader objective to actually apply these concepts in a future community project.
I am of the opinion that pure academic research is stale if not applied in a physical setting, though I understand that some research may serve to built upon further questioning.
With that being said, I hope to implement the information that I will gather from real people to affect real people, and verify if it would be possible to employ indirect means of public wellness management.
The concept is not new but is poorly implemented in neighborhoods that need it most, and I believe that a lack of attention towards the relevant academia is both a fault of lawmakers and of researchers.
By putting research into the real world, we both bring attention the problem we are studying and we are also verifying the veracity of our results.

It's a bit easier to do from me, since I've learned to approach people both linguistically (I learned 5 languages to compensate) and socially.
Nevertheless, I understand that I need a lot more experience to implement my ideals, and I hope to gather such experience in this course.
